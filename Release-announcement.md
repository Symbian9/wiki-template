  * Mapmaking with OpenOrienteering Mapper: first steps for beginners 

**Highlights in this version**

TODO: some features with screenshots / explanations, e.g. overprint, line edit tool, pick direction, rectangle tool snap, sample maps 

### Example maps

This version of Mapper comes with three example files. You can find them in the example folder of your Mapper install directory, e.g. C:/Program Files/OpenOrienteering Mapper 0.5.0/examples: 

  * Sprint sample from map "Landschaftspark Hachinger Tal" by Bettina Deixler 
  * Forest sample from map "Schlossbergholz" by Thomas Schöps 
  * Overprinting example 

### Editing tools

  * New line edit tool. Allows to edit rectangular objects while ensuring that they stay rectangular, and to switch line segments between straight and curved. 
  * Reworked rectangle tool. Now supports drawing 45 degree angles and snapping to previous lines. 
  * New cutout and cut away tools 
  * New experimental tools: convert to curves and simplify path 
  * New panning tool for users without mouse wheel or keyboard 
  * Path drawing tool: Ctrl+Click on existing objects to pick a direction from them 
  * Path closing tool: now connects open ends always to the closest other end 

### Import &amp; Export

  * Improved OCD, DXF and GPX import 
  * Image templates should be correctly located now in exported OCD files 
  * OMAP file format is now XML-based 

### Display

  * Overprinting simulation, based on spot color support 
  * Improved display of lines, especially with sharp angles 

### Other

  * Extensive, updated program documentation 
  * Reworked color window &amp; color editing dialog 
  * Reworked georeferencing dialog 
  * Reworked home screen 
  * Support for multi-page printing 
  * Improved selection possibilities in the symbol pane 
  * Course setting symbols now included in all symbol sets, including a basic all-in-one line symbol for start, controls and finish 
  * Program logo included in symbol sets 
  * Improved program icon 
  * Option to load most recent file on program startup 
  * Persistent toolbar and dock widget positions 
  * Program switched to Qt5 toolkit internally 
  * Many, many bugfixes and usability improvements 

**Note about overprinting**

If you have an existing map, you need to update its symbol set to benefit from the new overprint feature. To do so, choose Symbols -&gt; Replace symbol set... from the menu and choose the new symbol set from the location where Mapper is installed, for example C:/Program Files/OpenOrienteering Mapper 0.5.0/symbol sets/5000/ISSOM_5000.xmap. Then check if all symbols are replaced correctly and confirm with Ok. Now you can activate overprinting by clicking View -&gt; Overprinting simulation. 

**Note for Mac users**

For systems with activated Gatekeeper (10.8 Mountain Lion and partly also 10.7 Lion) the app has to be started once by right clinking on the file and choosing Open. This is because it is not code signed, which would require an annual license fee. 

**Documentation**

In addition to the [user forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/oorienteering/discussion/mapper/), there is now also a [user wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/oorienteering/wiki/Home/). It is pre-filled with the program manual. If you have hints to share with the mapper community or want to extend the program documentation, please create a SourceForge account and start editing it. 

Furthermore, a presentation "Mapmaking with OpenOrienteering Mapper: first steps for beginners" is now available to get you started quickly.

# 0.4

## Short announcement (English)

OpenOrienteering Mapper 0.4 was released today. This version of the free mapmaking program again brings many new features and improvements. 

Among them are for example the possibility to follow existing objects while drawing, a ring menu for quick access to the most common drawing tools and the ability to load templates which are georeferenced with world files. Furthermore it is possible to setup a map grid, the application loads the Swiss Scool symbol set correctly and supports a new XML based map file format which makes it easier for other programs to access the files. 

We recommend the update for all users of the 0.3.x versions. The complete list of improvements and the download link is in the official announcement: 

TODO: insert link

## Long announcement, Title: OpenOrienteering Mapper 0.4 provides a wealth of new features

After two maintenance releases in the 0.3.x series, the OpenOrienteering team is happy to release a new major version of its free mapping program, containing many new features and improvements. 

**Downloads**

  * Windows installer 
  * Windows ZIP archive 
  * (Mac OS X package (64-bit)) 
  * Ubuntu 12.04 package 32-bit (i386) 
  * Ubuntu 12.04 package 64-bit (amd64) 

**Important notice**

For ISSOM maps started with the 0.3.x versions of Mapper, the symbol set should be updated to correct some serious problems that have been found with it. See the bottom of this post for instructions. 

**Highlights**

### Editing tools

  * Appending to and following existing objects while drawing paths (hold Shift) 
  * Setting the direction of area fill patterns 
  * Right-click pie menu for quick tool switching without keyboard shortcuts 
  * Constrained angles for all editing tools (hold Ctrl) 
  * Vastly improved rectangle draw tool 
  * Different strategies for spline node deletion (with Ctrl, or Shift + Ctrl) 

### Templates

  * Loading of images which are georeferenced with world files 
  * Re-opening of closed templates while retaining their settings 

### Display

  * Display of a configurable map grid 
  * "Hatch areas" (F2) and "baseline" (F3) view modes to view templates through the map 
  * Toggle to hide or show all templates at once (F10) 

### Other

  * New map operation to rotate the whole map 
  * New map operation to exchange the symbol set 
  * Printing maps in a different scale 
  * Line symbols can have different borders on left and right side; makes Swiss Scool symbol sets load correctly 
  * New translation: French (thanks to Vincent Poinsignon) 
  * XML file format, allowing for easier exchange of map files with other programs 

**Screenshots (Examples)**

![](files/Mapper4_screenshot1.png) The ring-shaped context menu allows for quick access to tools. 

![](files/Mapper4_screenshot2.png) Existing objects can be traced by Shift-clicking them and dragging the mouse along them. 

![](files/Mapper4_screenshot3.png) Map grid and constrained angle drawing (by holding Ctrl). 

**User forum**

For all questions regarding the use of OpenOrienteering Mapper, we created a brand new user forum which can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/oorienteering/discussion/mapper/). This is separate from discussions about its development, which are done on the [mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/oorienteering-devel) as before. 

**Contributing**

If you want to work on a translation for Mapper, are a programmer with experience in C++ / Qt, or want to help in any other way, we would like to welcome you at our developer mailing list. Other useful places with resources are: 

  * Git repository with the latest code 
  * Bug tracker, the right place to lookup and report all kinds of issues with the program 
  * Developer wiki with information about the code, or how to start a new translation 

**How to: update the ISSOM symbol set**

  * Open your map. 
  * Choose Symbols -&gt; Replace symbol set... from the menu. 
  * Select the new ISSOM symbol file with the correct scale from your Mapper installation, for example C:/Program Files/OpenOrienteering Mapper 0.4.0/symbol sets/5000/ISSOM_5000.omap. 
  * Untick the checkbox "Match replacement symbols by symbol number". 
  * In the symbol list, scroll down to the two symbols with number 210 and choose the corresponding symbols numbered 210.1 and 210.2 on the right side, as shown here: 

![](files/Symbol_replacement_step1.png) 

  * Scroll further down to the symbol "Prominent man-made feature" in X shape, and choose the corresponding symbol numbered 540 on the right side, as shown here: 

![](files/Symbol_replacement_step2.png) 

  * Apply the changes by clicking Ok. 
  * In the new symbol set, the dash directions of fence symbols have been made consistent with those of other line symbols. This means that all fences will be flipped by this procedure. To correct this, do the following steps for every fence symbol in the symbol list on the right side: 
    * Right-click the symbol and choose "Select all objects with this symbol". 
    * Use the "Flip dash direction" tool. 
  * Done. As some color priorities of greens have been changed, you finally should have a look at the map and correct any problems that may occur. 

This procedure corrects among other things some wrong or duplicate symbol numbers, improves color priorities and most importantly fixes the problem that some symbols were incorrectly marked as "helper symbols", which makes them disappear when the map is printed. 

In case you run into problems with this, contact puzzlepaint at ymail.com for support.

# 0.2

## Second alpha version of OpenOrienteering Mapper

After many hours of work, the second alpha version of OpenOrienteering Mapper has been released today. Highlights of this version include: 

  * Import of OC*D 8 files, including symbol sets 
  * Addition of the text drawing tool 
  * Many new editing tools 
  * German translation 

You can read the full changelog here. 

(Link to this as a text file:) 

* * *

New tools: 

  * Text drawing tool 
  * Rotate tool 
  * Cut tool 
  * Cut hole tool 
  * Connect lines tool 

New actions: 

  * View whole map 
  * Set custom zoom factor 
  * Hide and protect symbols 

Other additions: 

  * OC*D 8 file import, including symbol sets 
  * German translation 
  * Fullscreen mode 
  * Symbols can be sorted by number 
  * Possibility to move and zoom the view without a mouse wheel 

Changes and fixes: 

  * Path points can be added and removed with the edit tool 
  * Combined objects are correctly updated by the 'Scale all symbols' action 
  * Paper size should always be set correctly when printing with a custom size 
  * Fix zooming for finer than normal mouse wheel steppings 
  * Rotation of point objects is correctly saved 
  * On Windows, more image formats are supported to be loaded as templates 
  * Useless geoid settings for georeferencing removed 
  * Allow only one instance of the program at a time 
  * Changed zoom behavior to be consistent for zooming in &amp; out 
  * Improved object selection for lines and areas 
  * Made the 'helper symbol' setting work 
  * Changed sign of Y part of coordinates so positive Y is up 
  * Reworked the 'new map' dialog 
  * Reworked the georeferencing dialog 

* * *

**Note**  
Even though this version represents a huge improvement over the first alpha, we still do not recommend to use it for map projects because the planned OC*D export feature and some basic editing tools are still missing. As far as it can be judged now, the next version after this one could include these and be the first version which will be recommended for mapping.
